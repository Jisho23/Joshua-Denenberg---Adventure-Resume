# Joshua-Denenberg---Adventure-Resume

This is a short game that is a supplement to my website and formal resume.

Instructions:
installation:
1) Clone or download the entire repo.
2) Run npm install.
3) Run either node server.js or npm start -- either will open a browser connected to the localhost5000 port (make sure that port is open)

Alternatively you can play the game online at this heroku repo: https://jdenenberg-adventure.herokuapp.com/ !

Story: I have locked you in my office and it is yours to explore. But, I won't let you out untill you find some key items and use them.
This is the most non-threatening escape room ever!
When you get an item, make sure to use it!

Controls:
The console only responds to 'go', 'look', 'take', and 'use'. There are some other hidden keywords, but no cheating!
All interactable objects (either to take or look) are in quotation marks.
If at any time you are lost you can also type 'help' to review the controls and rules.

Development:
This is a mostly hacked together version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-adventure with elements from novel.js and an earlier turn-based RPG project I worked on. Most of thebroox's engine is intact, but
I added some extra display elements (scrolling text) and methods.

I hope you enjoy!
